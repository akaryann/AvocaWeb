                    Except for improving oral English, we are trying to help people improve their logical minds, expression capacities, organizing capacities and so on.

                    Have you ever felt that when you have to talk to a foreigner, you cannot speak out a word?<br />
                    Everyone of us have learned English for years, but when being towards a foreigner, we are still weak.
                    <br /><br />
                    <h3>What Happened?</h3>
                    The main reason is that mastering a language is not only about what you have learned, but how often you use it. If we practice English everyday or even once a week, you'll see the difference. And this is what we are doing.
